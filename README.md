# Northwind Dataset Capstone Project

## Overview

This capstone project was completed using a combination of SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze the Northwind Dataset. The project involved extracting data from the Northwind database using SQL queries, performing data analysis and visualization in Python, and creating a dynamic dashboard in Power BI. Additionally, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas were used to enhance the Power BI dashboard.

## Northwind Dataset

The Northwind Dataset is a well-known sample database that simulates a fictional company's operations. It contains tables and data related to products, customers, orders, employees, and more. This dataset is often used for learning and practicing data analysis, SQL, and business intelligence tasks.

## Files Included

- **SQL Queries.sql**: This file contains the SQL queries used to extract and manipulate data from the Northwind Database.

- **Python Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file includes Python code for data analysis and manipulation. It covers tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, and basic statistical analysis.

- **Power BI Dashboard images**: This folder contains images or screenshots of the Power BI dashboard created for this project. The dashboard provides a visual representation of the data analysis and insights generated from the Northwind Dataset.

## Power BI Dashboard and DAX Formulas

The Power BI dashboard created for this project showcases the key findings and insights from the analysis. It utilizes DAX formulas, which are a collection of functions and expressions used to enhance data modeling and analysis in Power BI. DAX was employed to create custom calculations, measures, and visualizations that go beyond standard aggregation functions.

## Project Benefits

This capstone project offered valuable learning experiences by integrating multiple tools and technologies. Here are some of the benefits:

- **SQL Skills**: Developed proficiency in writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

- **Python Data Analysis**: Gained skills in using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.

- **Power BI Dashboard Creation**: Learned how to create interactive and informative dashboards in Power BI.

- **DAX Formula Usage**: Explored the power of DAX formulas for creating custom calculations and measures.

- **Data Integration**: Gained experience in connecting and integrating SQL, Python, and Power BI to provide end-to-end data analysis and visualization.

By completing this project, I have not only gained practical experience but also a deeper understanding of how these tools can be used together to extract valuable insights from data.

Feel free to explore the project files and the Power BI dashboard images to see the results of the analysis and visualization.
